## Welcome to Marina's Virtual Resume!

This is a virtual resume I created for my AP Comupter Science Priciples. 

This website was created using GitHub pages. If you want to learn more about GitHub pages, follow documentation found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
