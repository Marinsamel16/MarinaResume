## Welcome to Marina's Virtual Resume!

This is a virtual resume I created for my AP Comupter Science Priciples. 

This website was created using GitHub pages. If you want to learn more about GitHub pages, follow documentation found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Marinsamel16/MarinaResume/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
